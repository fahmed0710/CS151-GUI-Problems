Smallscale GUI coding problems (CS151)

4.15 - A program that shows a frame with two buttons labeled “Zoom in”, and “Zoom out”, 
and a label containing a car icon. As the user clicks the buttons, the car should get larger or smaller. 

4.18 - A class ClockIcon that implements the Icon interface type. 
There is an analog clock whose hour, minute, and second hands show the current time. 
To get the current hours and minutes, an object of type GregorianCalendar is constructed. 
(Clock hands for the hour, minute, and second are required to be drawn and move to represent a current time.)

4.20 - An enhanced ShapeIcon class so that it displays multiple moveable shapes. 
The animation program shows a number of moving cars. 

4.22 -The animation program from 4.20 is modified to make the moving shape reappear on the left-hand side after it disappears from the frame.

5.2 - A mouse listener is attached to a bar frame panel.
When the user clicks on a point, the nearest data point is moved to the mouse click. 
Then, the model is updated and both the number view and the graph view are notified of the change so that they can refresh their contents. 

5.4 - A program that contains a slider and a car icon. 
The size of the car should increase or decrease as the slider is moved.

mvc - When the program starts, the initial screen displays a button labeled "add", a blank text area, and a text field. 
A user places a line in the text field and clicks on the add button. 
Then, the text area displays the line. 
Each time the user enters a new line in a text field and clicks on the add button, the text area is updated displaying previously entered lines and the new line. 
The program follows the MVC model.
Listeners are implemented in an anonymous class.
Model is a separate class from the client (test) program.
